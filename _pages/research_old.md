  Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image. Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. We study state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to enable machines to see and learn as if humans do. <br><br><br>

  Natural language processing (NLP) is understanding complex language utterances and it is also a crucial part of AI. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks and these models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model. We study state-of-the-art deep learning models and seek to develop novel natural language deep learning models.<br><br>
