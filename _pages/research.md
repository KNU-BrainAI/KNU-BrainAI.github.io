# Research

We belive that better understanding of the brain could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. Since rapid progress has been made in the related
fields of the neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to investigate the critical and ongoing importance of neuroscience in generating ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research. Thus, we seek to narrow the gap between neuroscience and AI by understanding both research fields. Our lab is interested in the follwing research areas but not limited.

- Machine & Deep Learning

- Natual Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.
