# Research

We belive that better understanding of the brain could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. Since rapid progress has been made in the related fields of the neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to investigate the critical and ongoing importance of neuroscience in generating ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research. Thus, we seek to narrow the gap between neuroscience and AI by understanding both research fields. Our lab is interested in the follwing research areas but not limited.

  The brain provides a rich source of inspiration for new types of algorithms and architectures of artificial intelligence and can provide validation of artificial intelligence techniques that already exist. If a known algorithm is subsequently found to be implemented in the brain, then that is strong support for its plausibility as an integral component of an overall general intelligence system. As convolutional neural networks are inspired by the vision system in the brain, understanding brain functions is a key for developing novel deep learning models. Thus we study neuroscience to understand the brain and try to develop brain-like neural networks based on how the brain works.
  
- Natual language processing 
  
  Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. Thus we study state-of-the-art deep learning models and seek to develop novel deep learning models for NLP.
